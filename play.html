    <blockquote>
    <p class = "speech mercutio">Nay, I'll conjure too.<br>
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!<br>
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:<br>
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;<br>
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'<br>
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,<br>
    One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,<br>
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,<br>
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!<br>
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;<br>
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class = "speech benvolio">And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</p>    
    </blockquote>
    

    <h4 class = "name mercutio">MERCUTIO:</h4>
    <blockquote>
    <p class = "speech mercutio">This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him<br>
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle<br>
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand<br>
    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;<br>
    That were some spite: my invocation<br>
    Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name<br>
    I conjure only but to raise up him.</p>    
    </blockquote>
    

    <h4 class = "name benvolio">BENVOLIO:</h4>
    <blockquote>
    <p class = "speech benvolio">Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,<br>
    To be consorted with the humorous night:<br>
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4 class ="name mercutio">MERCUTIO:</h4>
    <blockquote>
    <p class = "speech mercutio">If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.<br>
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,<br>
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit<br>
    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.<br>
    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were<br>
    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!<br>
    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;<br>
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:<br>
    Come, shall we go?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4 class = "name benvolio">BENVOLIO:</h4>

    To seek him here that means not to be found.</p>
